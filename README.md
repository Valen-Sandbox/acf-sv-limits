# acf-sv-limits
A set of tools that server owners can use to place limits on commonly abused aspects of ACF-3. There's currently only one thing in here, but more are planned to come (hopefully).

## ConVars
- **acf_limits_caliber**: The maximum total ACF caliber that a player can have out at once (in mm)

## Requirements
- [ACF-3](https://github.com/Stooberton/ACF-3)
- Any CPPI-based prop protection addon
