# acf-sv-limits
A set of tools that server owners can use to place limits on commonly abused aspects of ACF-3. There's currently not much in here, but more is planned to come (hopefully).

## ConVars
- **acf_limits_caliber**: The maximum total ACF caliber that a player can have out at once (in mm). Set to 0 to disable limitations.
- **acf_limits_mass**: The maximum mass that a contraption may have before its weapons/engines are disabled (in whole kg). Set to 0 to disable limitations.
- **acf_limits_missiles**: The maximum number of missiles that a contraption may hold before its racks are disabled. Set to 0 to disable limitations.

## Requirements
- [ACF-3](https://github.com/Stooberton/ACF-3)
- [CFW](https://github.com/Stooberton/CFW)
- Any CPPI-based prop protection addon
